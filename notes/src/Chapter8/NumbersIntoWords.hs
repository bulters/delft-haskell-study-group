Fill in the implementations of the functions above so that wordNumber
returns the English word version of the Int value.

We’ve laid out multiple functions for you to consider as you tackle
the problem. You may not need all of them, depending on how you
solve it–these are just suggestions. Play with them and look up their
documentation to understand them in deeper detail.
You will probably find this difficult.

div :: Integral a => a -> a -> a
mod :: Integral a => a -> a -> a
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
concat :: [[a]] -> [a]
intersperse :: a -> [a] -> [a]
(++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
(:[]) :: a -> [a]
