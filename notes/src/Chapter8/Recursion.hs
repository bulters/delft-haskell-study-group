-- ! 1.
-- Write out the steps for reducing dividedBy 15 2 to its final answer
-- according to the Haskell code.

-- ! 2.
-- Write a function that recursively sums all numbers from 1 to n,
-- n being the argument. So that if n was 5, youâ€™d add 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
-- + 5 to get 15. The type should be (Eq a, Num a) => a -> a.

-- 3.
-- Write a function that multiplies two integral numbers using
-- recursive summation. The type should be (Integral a) => a ->
-- a -> a.
